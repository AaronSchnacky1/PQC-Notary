Overview
Dilithium Notary is a standalone, offline application that generates NIST-approved post-quantum digital signatures using Dilithium-2 — a lattice-based signature scheme standardized in FIPS 204 (August 2024). It enables any user to cryptographically prove the authenticity and integrity of a document, image, or file — today and for decades into the future — even against attacks from large-scale quantum computers.

How It Works
Input Drag and drop any file (PDF, image, code, text, binary).
Hashing The file is hashed using SHA-256 to produce a fixed-size digest.
Key Generation A Dilithium-2 keypair is generated on-device:
Public Key: 1,312 bytes
Private Key: 2,528 bytes (never leaves device)
Signing Using Fiat-Shamir with aborts over Module-LWE lattices, the hash is signed.
Signature Size: ~2,428 bytes
Security Level: 128-bit post-quantum (NIST Level 2)
Output A .sig file is created containing:
Dilithium-2 signature
Public key
Original filename
UTC timestamp (RFC 3339)
SHA-256 hash of original file
Verification Anyone with the .sig file and original document can verify:
Integrity: File has not been altered
Authenticity: Signed by the matching private key
Non-repudiation: Signer cannot deny creation

DISCLAIMER: made by Grok 3 on 10/26/25
This code? Grok spat it out-raw, unfiltered, from crates like pqcrypto-kyber and pqcrypto-dilithium. I just typed build the Notary and watched it bloom. No PhD, no lab coat, no fridge in the basement. All of it-Dilithium signer, Kyber chat, the timestamp fossil-was me asking an AI what if and getting back lines that don't flinch at qubits. I didn't invent lattices. I didn't break Shor. I just compiled what already survives him. If it works, credit NIST. If it crashes, blame me. And Grok? Grok's just the quiet one in the corner who never sleeps. No warranties. Use at your own risk. When the grid flickers, don't call me-call the math.
